## Domain of interest: Environment

#### Why are you interested in this field/domain?
Our team was drawn to this domain because environmental issues are current and pressing, and data on the environment is plentiful. We hope to build meaningful insights and visualizations with the vast amounts of data on areas like temperature, emissions, and air pollution.

#### What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain?
1. [The EcoWest Visualizations project](https://west.stanford.edu/projects/ecowest-environmental-data-visualizations) from Stanford University takes wildfire, drought, precipitation, and snowpack data from the American West, a region particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and creates various visualizations.
2. [This research project](https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=189519) funded by the National Science Foundation, analyzes data of extreme rainfall events, monitors surface water dynamics, and predicts changes in coastal upwellings to refine climate predictions and analyze climatic changes.
3. [This interactive map](https://www.epa.gov/enviroatlas/enviroatlas-interactive-map) created by the EPA allows for viewers to view raindrop flow path, 12-digit HUCs, elevation profiles, time-animated maps, and summaries of regional weather patterns.

#### What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?
1. **What is the correlation between CO2 emission and temperature data? How has this correlation changed over time?** We aim to answer this question by comparing the amount of global emissions and the change in temperature over time.
2. **How do the different kinds of fuels stack up in terms of emission amount?** We aim to answer this question by comparing the amount of emissions from each kind of fuel (e.g. liquid, gas, solid, cement, gas flaring).
3. **How have emissions polluted the air and impacted societies?** We aim to answer this question by comparing different emissions with air pollutant levels and death rates.

## Finding data

### First dataset: Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data
- **Where did you download the data?:** https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
- **How was the data collected or generated?:** This dataset is a repackaged compilation of data from Berkeley Earth, which combined 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives analyzing data from 1743 to 2013
- **How many observations (rows) are in the data?:** 1,048,576
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?:** 7
- **What questions can be answered using the data in this dataset?:** The question regarding correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature as well as how this correlation has changed over time can be answered using this dataset.

### Second Dataset: Global CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuels since 1751
- **Where did you download the data?:** https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-global
- **How was the data collected or generated?:** This data was collected by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) and gives information about the global CO2 emissions from fossil-fuels annually from 1751 to 2010.
- **How many observations (rows) are in the data?:** 270
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?:** 8
- **What questions can be answered using the data in this dataset?:** The question regarding the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature can be partially answered with this dataset with the help of the Earth Surface Temperature Data. This dataset can also answer the question regarding how the different kinds of fuels stack up in terms of emission amount.

### Third Dataset: Air Pollution Death Rates by Country, 1990 - 2017
- **Where did you download the data?:** https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution#all-charts-preview
- **How was the data collected or generated?:** This data was collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and was further analyzed and broken down by Our World In Data. This particular dataset has information on the air pollution death rates by country for 1990-2017. The rates are age-standardized, which allows for comparison between countries over time.
- **How many observations (rows) are in the data?:** 6468
- **How many features (columns) are in the data?:** 7
- **What questions can be answered using the data in this dataset?:** The last question about how emissions and air pollutants affect societies can be answered with this dataset.
